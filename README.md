# python3_p2pkill

p2pkill

Useage:
 p2pkill try to kill terminal p2p process like ThunderPaltform.exe
 when main process like Thunder is already exit,but his child process is still on you PC
 waste your CPU and RAM resources

 if you want to clean their chilad process,just write someline in foo.txt like next:

 Thuder.exe:ThuderPaltform.exe
 BaiduYunxxx.exe:baiduPaltformxxx.exe

写英文readme纯粹为了装逼，看不懂的面壁去吧，哈哈！！
